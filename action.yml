      performing Unit Tests, making builds or preparing data.
      To return an error from the command line process,
      either throw an exception which causes Unity to exit with return code 1,
      or call EditorApplication.Exit with a non-zero return code.
      To pass parameters, add them to the command line and retrieve them inside the function using System.Environment.GetCommandLineArgs.
